Columns

sub: Subject number. Note, may not be sequential.  Misses in the sequence are inconsequential and reflect a participant who didnt show up.

blk: Block.  First two are short practice blocks, remaining six are experimental blocks.

blkType: Block Type.  0=Prosaccade, 1=Antisaccade

trl: Trial number. 0-49 for the 50 trials.

dur: Target duration.  Number of frames the target was displayed at 75hz.

isLet: Target identity.  Short for isLet==M. 0='X'; 1='M'.

oriT: Angle of target placement.  Standard angle parameterization used in trig functions.

oriC: Angle of cue placement.  Standard angle parameterization used in trig functions.

resp: Response, 0='X', 1='M'.

rt: Response time. From end of 2nd mask.

acc:  Accuracy,  resp==isLet.

-----

Cleaning:  There are no cleaning steps here.  These data need to be cleaned.  Please see any papers that reference these data for appropriate cleaning steps.

```{r}
fname=system("ls -1 as12-75S*",intern=T)
dat=NULL

for (i in fname) dat=rbind(dat,read.csv(i,head=F))

                  'dur','isLet','oriT','oriC',
                  'resp','rt','acc')
acc= as.integer(as.factor(dat$acc))
write.csv(file="as12All.csv",dat,row.names = F,quote = F)
